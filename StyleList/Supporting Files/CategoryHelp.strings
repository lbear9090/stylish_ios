"1970sTrend" = "The 1970s were all about those flared jeans, multicolored shirts and even tracksuits. Although it isn’t as popular today, there are certain watered-down versions of it that make it more palatable. The 1970s trend is associated with the hippie movement that helped popularize it. ";
"Biker" = "The Biker style makes heavy use of leather jackets and pants, ripped jeans and slim-fit shirts. As a rule of thumb, all the elements that compile the outfit have got to be dark. This style has a note of elegance to it if used well and can easily turn some heads around. ";
"BlackonBlack" = "The name of the style should be enough of a clue as to what it requires: black clothing, entirely or partially. It is, obviously, a casual-type of style that is perfect to be worn when talking a walk or even going down to the grocery store. Here’s a tip: wear white sneakers to emphasize the black. ";
"Businessman" = "The Casual Businessman trend is meant to make a man look good both at the office and out on the street, as it frequently features jackets, simple jeans, and stylish shoes. The trend stands to show that sometimes, a common polo shirt can be better than a super official one. ";
"Casual" = "We could say that the casual style perfectly balances elegance and comfort, with an ounce of chicness. At the time being, this style is most commonly met, as it is easy to incorporate. A typical casual outfit would be a pair of fitting jeans, a beautiful, cashmere or wool sweater, and an oversized blazer. ";
"CasualBusinessman" = "The Casual Businessman trend is meant to make a man look good both at the office and out on the street, as it frequently features jackets, simple jeans, and stylish shoes. The trend stands to show that sometimes, a common polo shirt can be better than a super official one. ";
"Classy" = "This implies the idea of wearing a suit or a combination of casual jeans with a nice jacket. To a certain extent, it’s just a subcategory of the Businessman style, but this one is more allowing in terms of what you can wear and still remain, as the name says it, classy. ";
"Country" = "Denim jackets, shirts, boots, and hats – this is everything you need in order to nail the country style. This is very popular in the rural American areas, but it works just as fine on the streets of a city, especially if the outfit is put together tastefully.";
"Cuban Collar" = "This trend is by excellence one that sky-rockets on the onset of summer. It’s one of the simplest yet most effective trends at the moment. All you need to pull it off is, of course, a Cuban collar shirt, which has this touristy note about it. Elvis, for instance, was a fan of this trend. ";
"Formal" = "The Formal style is the pickiest man style. T-shirts are not allowed: you’ve got to wear a suit, a tie and nice shoes to get it right. This is the style corporatists and business owners are into. It’s got a very steadfast dress code that cannot be violated if you mean business.";
"Funky" = "This is perhaps the most bohemian style of all. The rule is “There are no rules!” Pants can be of any color, you can wear a bandana with a bowtie – anything you can imagine would work as long as there’s an explosion of color – not to be taken as kitsch. ";
"Gangster" = "This particular style is a shout-out to the classiness of the criminals from the ‘20s. It is best represented by tailored suits with the classic stripes, fedoras and ties or bowties, as well as suspenders. It’s a style that has defied time and goes on stronger with every passing year.";
"Hawaiian" = "The Hawaiian trend can make you feel like you’re in a paradisiac retreat even when you’re thousands of miles away from it. It relies heavily on shirts with flower patterns and sometimes on Hawaiian landscapes. It works best with a cigar in the corner of the mouth and a cocktail in your hand! ";
"Hipster" = "The hipster trend draws heavy inspiration from vintage clothing with a sprinkle of what makes people automatically think of indie music. The trend usually features slim-fit, above-the-ankle jeans, shirts, scarves, beanies, glasses, leather shoes and various hats.  Sweaters, jackets and suspenders are common, too.   ";
"Lumbersexual" = "The Lumbersexual Trend is as much of a lifestyle as it is a fashion fad and it has transformed the usual attire of the lumberjack into a worldwide craze. The trend usually features a shirt with square patterns and jeans and indispensably a beard, a couple of tattoos and glasses (optional).";
"Post-Soviet" = "This somewhat political aesthetic has gotten a lot of attention lately. To some extent, any piece of clothing that has Russian letters on it falls into the PS trend. So do leather jackets, jumpsuits, hoodies, etc. It is somehow reminiscent of the punk/skinhead fashion that is still in vogue today.";
"Preppy" = "This particular trend is fundamentally for those who want to sport a college-y look, so it features polo shirts with large collars and V neck sweaters. The Preppy trend is immediately recognizable by the fact that the one who dresses as such looks like he wears a college, alumnus uniform. ";
"Retro" = "The Retro trend refers to a style that encompasses all the “vintage” trends starting with the ‘20s and well into the ‘80s. Printed, multicolored shirts and jeans with suspenders, scarves, sweaters, flared pants and bowties are just the peak of the iceberg when it comes to the elements you can use to pull off a retro outfit. ";
"Rockster" = "The Rockster style is almost synonymous with the biker style that inspired it in the first place. Leather jackets, bandanas tied to black jeans and various chains are frequent elements. It is as casual as it is elegant and just a tad menacing in certain circumstances. It suits pretty much all men.";
"Sexy" = "The Sexy style needs, first of all, the right attitude and then the fitting clothes to go with that. It is usually worn with a beard and clothes that emphasize your physical appearance, especially when you work out. The clothes don’t matter as much as your attitude, keep that in mind. ";
"Smart" = "Get a nice suit, a leather bag and a pair of sunglasses and you got yourself dressed according to the smart style. This is a classy yet extremely casual style and can have different variations like, a white shirt, black jacket and jeans (ripped or not). ";
"Sportswear" = "The Sportswear, also known as Activewear Trend, was first popularized during the ‘90s and it made a surprising comeback last year, with trainers, tennis shirts, sneakers, jerseys and all sorts of polos becoming in vogue again, especially among teenagers. All in all, it’s a style that makes you look like you’re about to hit the gym. ";
"Street" = "Actually, the street style could be best described as a loose mixture of multiple styles. It can represent an outfit put together with a coat, sweater and a pair of jeans, as well as a leather jacket, sweater and hoodie. It is a somewhat elusive style, since it defies a clean-cut description. ";
"Urban" = "The Urban style is extremely popular among millennials and is usually representative of the rap genre of music. It features really casual outfits with large t-shirts, jeans, and sneakers, plus caps and sunglasses. It is one of the oldest and most enduring styles in the world.";
"Utilitarian" = "Cargo pants, factory clothing, pants down the boots, camouflage clothes, leather bags and denim – these are just a few of the things that compile the Utilitarian trend. Basically, this trend mixes casual outfits with garments that would usually go in industrial uniforms. It is manifold with even the cowboy outfit being Utilitarian.";
